# CISxIdeas-Hackathon
This code was developed for Goxip for a Hackathon. It gives personalized product recommendations based on various factors.
Due to my limited access to Goxip's database I used some dummy databases to run the code. Furthermore I am unable to track the activities of the user in the website due to the same reason. Nevertheless the code works properly and gives recomendations based on various characteristics.
